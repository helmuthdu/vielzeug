# Introduction

Welcome to **Vielzeug** (German for "many tools"), a modular TypeScript toolkit designed for building modern, type-safe, and high-performance applications.

## Philosophy

Vielzeug is built on the belief that a well-designed toolkit should be:

- **Modular**: Only use what you need. Each package is independent and tree-shakeable.
- **Type-Safe**: First-class TypeScript support with deep inference.
- **Zero/Low Dependencies**: Minimize your supply chain risk and bundle size.
- **Consistent**: A unified API design across all packages makes it easy to switch between them.

## The Toolkit at a Glance

The Vielzeug ecosystem is organized into several focused packages:

### Core & Utilities

- **[Logit](/logit/)**: Beautiful and flexible logging for development and production.
- **[Toolkit](/toolkit/)**: 100+ essential utilities for arrays, objects, math, and more.

### Data & State

- **[Deposit](/deposit/)**: Type-safe local storage with schemas and expiration.
- **[Fetchit](/fetchit/)**: Modern HTTP client with intelligent caching and deduplication.
- **[Stateit](/stateit/)**: Tiny, framework-agnostic reactive state management.

### Frontend & Logic

- **[Formit](/formit/)**: Flexible, type-safe form state and validation.
- **[Validit](/validit/)**: Powerful schema validation with advanced error handling.
- **[i18nit](/i18nit/)**: Lightweight, type-safe internationalization.

### Architecture & Security

- **[Permit](/permit/)**: Simple yet powerful Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **[Routeit](/routeit/)**: Lightweight, type-safe client-side routing with middleware support.
- **[Wireit](/wireit/)**: Lightweight dependency injection container.

## Why Vielzeug?

Modern development often involves choosing between massive "everything-in-one" libraries or hundreds of tiny, inconsistent packages. Vielzeug offers a middle ground: a curated collection of high-quality, consistent tools that work perfectly together but can also be used individually.

Whether you're building a small utility script or a complex enterprise application, Vielzeug provides the building blocks you need without the bloat.

## Getting Started

To get started, we recommend exploring the [Toolkit](/toolkit/) for general-purpose utilities, or diving into a specific package that meets your current needs.
